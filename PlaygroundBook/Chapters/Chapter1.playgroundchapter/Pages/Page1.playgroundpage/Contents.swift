 ## Story About Pencil
 
 Once I owned a pile of colored pencils, long and short.✏️ Love them to depict a sense of whimsy, also to write down moments in life sincerely.🌈
 
 However, the colors of life are never to be the same.
 
 Blue is my favorite so that used out unconsciously, in contrast with surplus black.
 I wonder if I can express the color distribution of the world by different speed that runs out of diverse colors.
 
 I always have fantastic ideas.😆😜
 I think, if I own an infinite amount of colored pencils, that is not an easy work to judge which color is used the most or the least, or just right in the middle.
 I have to sort them...
 How to be the fastest?
 This is the beginning.
 To help "*me*" who had fancy, or "*you*"!
