 # My strategy
 ----
 ## 🎉 🎉 🎉
 Congratulations! you have finished last round.
 
 Now, let's talk about the strategy.
 
 I will share mine,and you can learn it by clicking 'Swap' and 'Min'.
 
 You are **not** allowed to exchange by yourself.
 
 Now you can see we have a extra button 'Min'.
 ### Usage:
 This button is designed to select the shorter pencil.
 
 ## My strategy
 My strategy has 3 steps.🕹
 
 ### 1. Find the min one from unsorted pencils.
 ### 2. Swap min and the top one from unso rt.
 ### 3. Then repeat until sorting them.

 It's interesting that this strategy is a classic algorithm named 🔑**Select Sort**.
 So , you have picked up a computer algorithm in this funny way.🎮
 
 After passing,look back to play,and I sure you can sort faster.
 
 Have a good time ! 👨‍💻*/
