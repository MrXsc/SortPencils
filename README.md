# SortPencils

WWDC 19 ğŸ‘½

I've madeÂ an educational game ğŸ™ƒ. 

Learning computer science becomes more and more popular, but computer knowledge is complex and difficult to children. In view of this situation, I develop a game system to help young people in a fun way. This part of the whole plan is about the algorithm. Users are able to grasp the principles of Selection Sort involuntarily, a basic sorting algorithm in computer science. 

By utilizing **UIKit** framework, this game is vivid so that kids will have more interest. I manage to design some cool animation, and I also use **Playgroundbook** to exploit the particular advantages of games and courses. besides,in order to make it more interesting, I used the **AVFoundation** to add sound effects (which are all under CC0 license) to some actions.

MyÂ chapterÂ mainlyÂ consistsÂ ofÂ threeÂ pages:Â pointing,swappingÂ andÂ sorting. On the first page, users only need to select buttons and match the subscript. Next, hit and try sorting by swapping operation instinctively. 
OnÂ theÂ finalÂ page, A new button is added to find the shortest pencil. Nowï¼Œthis algorithm is simplified into the three simple steps. Hopefully, throughÂ thisÂ process, it will enable users to sort using Selection Sort.Â 

Have a good time! ğŸ˜ƒ
